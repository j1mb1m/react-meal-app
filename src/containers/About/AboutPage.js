        It is not a secret that our meals influence our mood. Also it is very important for our health. Every single person should eat proper kinds of food – dairy products, meat, fruit and vegetables, fats and sugars, cereals and grains. Dairy products provide us with calcium, meat provide our bodies with protein, iron, zinc. Eating fruit and vegetables helps to keep us healthy too because they give us fibre, vitamins and minerals. We should eat fats and sugars in moderation, because too much fats and sugars can cause different heart-diseases. Cereals and grains are important for us because they provide us with the energy we need for physical activity.

        In this fast-moving world it is necessary to watch what we eat – it should be healthy food, not junk one, which has become very popular. Eating too much junk food can cause overweight and a heart-disease. For example, it is much better to eat an apple or a banana than to eat a double hamburger with ketchup and mayonnaise. You will feel full in both cases, but a fruit or a vegetable is healthier.

        Eating habits are different in different countries. For example, Brazilians never eat with their hands – they always use a knife and a fork, even when they eat hotdogs. Finns like to eat hot sausages and drink beer in
        the streets; many Philipinos prefer to eat with their hands. Also they think that it is polite to leave a little food on the plate at the end of a meal.
        But anyway, whatever you like you should remember words of wisdom which say that we eat to live, but not live to eat.

        In fact, the issue of eating is not a major issue for living beings if they know how to do it in moderation. Eating becomes a way of replenishing our body to enable us to stay alive. However, on the contrary to the theory, we produce food and promote it to be consumed for pleasure. This creates a disturbance to the balance of our mind and body. The more we eat, the more disturbances are caused. There is a saying; “If we eat to live, there is no problem; but if we live to eat then that’s when the problem starts”.
